# vercel miniguide

1. Changes since template

```sh
bun add @photonjs/vercel
bun add h3 # This was necessary unfortunately
```

You will also notice doing `bun run build` creates `.vercel/output`

That's it.

2. Notes on the platform.

- Framework Preset: Vite (auto-detected)
- Other than that, no need to change anything. It works automatically.
